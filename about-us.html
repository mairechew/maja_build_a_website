          <p>
              I was born in the Panama Canal Zone,  and had the priviledge to grow up in Japan on military installations.
              I first came back to Colorado in 2008 and went to Colorado State University and have my degree in Business Administration.
              I have always loved the outdoors and physical activities.  During the week, you'll find me on the golf course or playing soccer.
              On the weekends, you will find my wife and I hiking, biking or trail running, and skiing during the winter.
              I love traveling and always try to carve out some time each year to go some place new and experience new cultures.
              I speak spanish, I grew up overseas, I lived in GITMO, (guantanimo bay) Cuba for a year and I've ski-dived!
              Cooking (and by cooking, I mean my wife's cooking) is one of my favortie pastimes and I have been proclaimed as a donut aficionado!
